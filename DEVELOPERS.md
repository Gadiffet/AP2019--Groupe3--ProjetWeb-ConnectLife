<h2><i>How to Setup and Launch the Project :</i></h2>

### GitBash Configuration

If you want to clone the project correctly, you must install [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
If you don't install it, your computer doesn't have the environment variable to clone the project.
But you can Download it with GitUI but it's not recommended.


### XAMPP Configuration

You must install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (with the current version used by the project)

### Clone Project

Open your terminal (CMD, Bash, PowerShell, ...), and use your <i>"Change Directory"</i> to find <i>"htdocs"</i> file in XAMPP

Normaly, <i>"htdocs"</i> is here :
```
C:\xampp\htdocs
```
Now, you must clone the project with your terminal :

"SCREEN IS COMMING SOON"

After the clone, all the project files are in <i>"htdocs"</i>
